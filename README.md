# Vaccinator

Vaccinator is a covid-19 themed game based on the pandemic. The goal of the game is to survive as many outbreaks of covid-19 as possible. The player is the vaccine, it is your job to take down as many viruses as you can while protecting the people behind you from getting infected. Press the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to shoot. Every time the vaccine gets hit by a virus, the vaccine loses health, and once the player's health is zero the game is over. There is also another catch, if the virus reaches the people at the bottom, you lose a life. Once all the people are infected the game is over, and it will automatically restart.
